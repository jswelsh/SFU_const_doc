---

1. Any member(s) of the club, who is deemed a member of a provincial representative team as defined in Section 3, shall have a percentage of their membership fees waived for the year following their representative season, pursuant to Section 6 hereinafter.
2. The purpose of waiving membership fees based on representative team participation is to;
    1. attract elite players to the club,
    2. to retain current representative players, and
    3. to encourage current members to participate in representative team programs.
3. Membership on a representative team will only refer to membership on the following teams: Canada Senior and Under-21 Men, Canada Senior And Under-23 Women, BC Senior Men, BC Senior Women, A Rugby Canada Super League Team (RCSL), BC Under-21 Men, BC Under-19 Women, BC Under-18 Men, BC Under-17 Girls And BC Under-16 Boys.
4. If in any given year, a representative team does not exist (ie. The British Columbia Rugby Union has opted not to run a particular representative program for the year), membership on a regional team (Vancouver, the Valley or Vancouver Island) shall be deemed equivalent eligibility to an RCSL team for a percentage of membership fees waived.
5. If no member of the club has trialled and represented any of the above teams, membership on a regional team (Vancouver, the Valley or Vancouver Island) shall be deemed equivalent eligibility to an RCSL team for a percentage of membership fees waived.
6. The percentage of membership fees waived shall be determined as follows:
    1. Up to a maximum of 25% of funds available in the club account, excluding long term savings and the club U-21 account may be put towards the calculation of waiving membership fees. This percentage is subject to change by the executive depending on the financial status of the club. A change as such shall be voted on in a regular executive meeting no less than 7 days prior to the first official practice of the year. A quorum for such a meeting shall be as that of a regular executive meeting. (Article III–Organization 3).
    2. All membership fees waived will be made available to the club membership as a whole regardless of an individual’s race, creed, sex or religion. The financial status of the club shall not be jeopardized in order to support representative team players. Every effort will be made to ensure membership fees do not rise as a direct result of waiving representative team player's fees.
    3. Members shall receive waivers of fees based on the following table:

          | Representative                                       |Max % of fees waived|
          | -------------                                        | :---------------:  |
          |Canada senior and under-21 men                        |        125%        |
          |Canada senior and under-23 women                      |        125%        |
          |BC senior men, BC senior women                        |        100%        |
          |A rugby Canada super league team (RCSL)               |        100%        |
          |BC under-21 men, BC under-19 women                    |        75%         |
          |BC under-18 men, BC under-17 girls, BC under-16 boys  |        50%         |

    The percentages in the above table may not be accumulated. If, for instance, a member participates on both the BC under-21 men’s team, a waiver will only be considered for the team that allows for the greater percentage of fees waived. Therefore, only a maximum of 100% of their fees will be waived. The executive will waive fees as best they can, making every effort to waive the following year’s fees based on the above table.
    
    4. The club expects members who receive fee waivers from the club to
        1. Demonstrate a high level of commitment to the club and their representative team
        2. Attend all training sessions and matches (injured players are expected to work with club coaches to continue their participation)
        3. Participate in all club fundraising and player recruitment efforts, and
        4. Provide sufficient proof to the executive of their participation on any of the above representative teams.
    5. At the discretion of the executive, any unallocated funds may be returned to the club account for use in the following year.
